# .env 

This folder contains the .env files needed to run the program.

It is to be used as a centralized location for string variables 
that would otherwise be buried inside code and be difficult to 
locate and change easily. 

### Naming convention
The naming convention should follow this simple rule. 
Start the file name with .env and follow it with .whatever:

.env.whatever

To create unique .env files for different sections of the project.
